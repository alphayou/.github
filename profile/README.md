# Introduction

[Alpha You](https://github.com/alphayou) is a _personal_ organization that houses some of [Fuon](https://github.com/fuon7)'s _individual_ projects. All projects under Alpha You will be fully open-sourced under specific OSS licenses, fostering strong connections with the community and growing alongside everyone involved. We hope for smooth sailing ahead!

The name of the organization is from [KAF](https://www.youtube.com/@virtual_kaf)'s song [あるふぁYOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUwdJ9evnBk), which symbolizes new beginnings and a new generation. Additionally, the word "Alpha" is often used at the start of software pre-releases, capturing the initial excitement and drive behind Alpha You.

Overall, the projects within Alpha You are distinctly **opinionated** and reflect my personal pursuits and insights into _specific product types_. The phrase _"May this reach you"_ expresses my intent to create products tailored for specific audiences, with an emphasis on UX and DX. While these projects are not initially designed to be broadly generic, I will strive to make them as adaptable as possible without compromising their core essence.
